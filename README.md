# FHEalth: Fully Homomorphic Encryption for Advanced Life-saving Technology and Healthcare

### **Project Overview**
**FHEalth** is a privacy-first healthcare platform built on the Internet Computer (ICP) that utilizes **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to ensure sensitive medical data can be securely stored, shared, and analyzed without ever being decrypted. FHEalth allows patients and healthcare providers to safely collaborate by leveraging encrypted data, ensuring that personal health information remains private throughout the entire process, even during computation.

By incorporating FHE, **FHEalth** provides advanced AI-driven analytics, such as predictive health models and risk assessments, while maintaining the highest level of data privacy. With FHEalth, users maintain full control over their encryption keys, allowing for secure data access and sharing on their terms.


### **Vision**
The vision of **FHEalth** is to revolutionize the healthcare industry by offering a **privacy-preserving platform** that empowers patients to control their medical data securely. Our goal is to provide a solution where:
- **Patients maintain complete control** over their sensitive health data while still benefiting from AI-driven insights.
- **Healthcare providers can collaborate with patients** using encrypted data, ensuring that personal information is never exposed, even during computation.
- **Advanced AI models offer personalized healthcare insights** while respecting data privacy.
- **Global accessibility** to privacy-first healthcare solutions becomes the standard for secure medical services worldwide.

We envision a future where **security and privacy are intrinsic** to every health data interaction, redefining trust between patients, healthcare providers, and technology.

### **Features and Functionality**
1. **Privacy-Preserving Computation**: FHEalth enables encrypted medical data processing on ICP canisters, allowing healthcare providers to run AI-driven analytics on sensitive data without decryption.
   
2. **Secure Medical Records Storage**: Patient records are encrypted and stored in ICP canisters, ensuring data privacy. Only patients and authorized parties can access the data using encryption keys.

3. **AI-Assisted Health Analytics**: The platform integrates AI models to provide health insights (e.g., disease prediction, risk assessments) directly on encrypted data, ensuring that data privacy is maintained throughout the process.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**: FHEalth offers an intuitive interface for patients and healthcare providers, simplifying data uploads, sharing, and management of encrypted medical records.

5. **End-to-End Encryption**: All interactions on the platform, from data storage to computation, are fully encrypted, ensuring the highest level of security for patient data.

## Installation & Setup

### **Prerequisites**
- [DFINITY SDK](https://sdk.dfinity.org/) installed to develop canisters on the Internet Computer.
- [Microsoft SEAL](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL) or a similar FHE library for encryption/decryption operations.
- **Rust** and **Motoko** programming languages for canister development.

### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/FHEalth.git
cd FHEalth

## Deploying the Canisters

### Start the Local Internet Computer Development Environment:
```bash
dfx start


### Deploy the Canisters:

dfx deploy


###  Running the Client-Side Encryption
Install the necessary dependencies for Microsoft SEAL or your chosen FHE library.
Run the encryption script locally before sending data to the canister:
python encrypt_data.mo

Upload the encrypted data to the canister.
Decryption Process
After receiving the encrypted results from the canister, run the decryption script:
python decrypt_data.mo


### Usage
